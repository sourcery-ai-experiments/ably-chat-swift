// This is a Sendable equivalent of ably-cocoa’s ARTRealtimePresenceQuery type.
//
// Originally, ``Presence.get(params:)`` accepted an ARTRealtimePresenceQuery object, but I’ve changed it to accept this type, because else when you try and write an actor that implements ``Presence``, you get a compiler error like "Non-sendable type 'ARTRealtimePresenceQuery' in parameter of the protocol requirement satisfied by actor-isolated instance method 'get(params:)' cannot cross actor boundary; this is an error in the Swift 6 language mode".
//
// Now, based on my limited understanding, you _should_ be able to send non-Sendable values from one isolation domain to another (the purpose of the "region-based isolation" and "`sending` parameters" features added in Swift 6), but to get this to work I had to mark ``Presence`` as requiring conformance to the `Actor` protocol, and since I didn’t understand _why_ I had to do that, I didn’t want to put it in the public API.
//
// So, for now, let’s just accept this copy (which I don’t think is a big problem anyway); we can always revisit it with more Swift concurrency knowledge in the future. Created https://github.com/ably-labs/ably-chat-swift/issues/64 to revisit.
