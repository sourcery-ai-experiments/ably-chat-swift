// A non-throwing `AsyncSequence` (means that we can iterate over it without a `try`).
//
// This should respect the `BufferingPolicy` passed to the `subscribe(bufferingPolicy:)` method.
//
// At some point we should define how this thing behaves when you iterate over it from multiple loops, or when you pass it around. I’m not yet sufficiently experienced with `AsyncSequence` to know what’s idiomatic. I tried the same thing out with `AsyncStream` (two tasks iterating over a single stream) and it appears that each element is delivered to precisely one consumer. But we can leave that for later. On a similar note consider whether it makes a difference whether this is a struct or a class.
//
// I wanted to implement this as a protocol (from which `MessageSubscription` would then inherit) but struggled to do so (see https://forums.swift.org/t/struggling-to-create-a-protocol-that-inherits-from-asyncsequence-with-primary-associated-type/73950 where someone suggested it’s a compiler bug), hence the struct. I was also hoping that upon switching to Swift 6 we could use AsyncSequence’s `Failure` associated type to simplify the way in which we show that the subscription is non-throwing, but it turns out this can only be done in macOS 15 etc. So I think that for now we’re stuck with things the way they are.
